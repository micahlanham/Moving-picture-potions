                    <p>This is a brief description of movie 1. It's just to help you choose between the movie choices.</p>

                        <p>Will you be able to decide? It's a tough decision, which movie to watch. Of course, if you try all of the drink selections, you quickly will not care which movie you are watching.</p>

                        <p>Movie 5 is kinda dumb. You don't want this choice. It'd be worse than watching paint dry.</p>
